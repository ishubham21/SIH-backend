## Celestial Bytes
The application aims to solve the lack of
 holistic development among kids, which is currently affecting over 52 lakh children in India. We help parents to unite with their children and push them towards their maximum potential. We aim at doing this by combining the future of the world and the heritage of India, which is AI and Yoga. Along with that, Sumedha also provides children with incisiveÂ  modules, which help them in the area of cognitive development.

## Our Solution
The team has created a PWA that helps parents with aiding and tracking the holistic growth of their children. This contains 2 different platforms, one to be handled by parents and the other to be accessed by kids but to be created by parents themselves. This would help parents in ensuring holistic development of kids through a collaborative application.

| This platform contains the features where a parent can add details or create an account for their child, assign them tasks based on their level of growth and development, and most importantly, parents get to keep a complete progress card record of every step, from the overall app percentile of the child to the graphical representation of every task performed. Along with that, parents also get to book meets with the nearest paediatrician, get access to blogs about parenting and can check the milestones of their child | The child's platform deals with the tasks assigned via the parents' platform. Children get to perform activities like brain quizzes for their cognitive growth and AI-guided yoga and art tests with deep learning models. The parents step-by-step track all these tasks performed by kids. Since games are one of the best brain development sources, we have added the most recommended mind games. To keep the children motivated, every time the child completes a task, they are awarded some virtual coins depending on their performance. These coins can later be redeemed against story books and goodies. |

## Unique points
1. The project is built as a PWA, so that it can be accessed on any device.
2. Scalability: Developed a modular monolithic service-based MVC architecture with a docker-run postgres database to help distribute
quickly as per the load requirements.
3. Used Prisma as an ORM to generate migrations, querying & deploying the database, improving the query response
time, and maintaining an admin dashboard.
3. Admin Dashboard: We desire for the government to handle the admin dashboard of Sumedha. This way, all the resources and knowledge that are to be made available to the parents about their child's holistic growth can be in the legal hands with enough resources.
4. In-app profile: To keep the application safe and child protected, an in-app feature has been induced which will keep kids from using their parents' mail id for any other activity outside the app.
5. Two separate platforms have been created so that children will only have access to a few resources that will benefit them.
6. Milestones checks for different ages.

## Future plans
1. Create lessons that are specific to the area in which your child is falling behind.
2. Post notifications for daily activity.
3. Children's profile switching will be prevented by facial recognition.
4. Implementing an in-memory redis caching layer results in the API's speed boost.
5. Track and limit screen time on the app for children.
6. Payment integration
